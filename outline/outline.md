# JMAGIC OUTLINE

This is an app for storing and organising magic the gathering cards using the Scryfall API.

A user should be able to log in, add cards to a collection, view their collection, delete cards from their collection, and export to various formats.

In later editions, a user should be able to make a deck, and be able to transfer digital cards from their collection to their deck, so the user can track where each card is.
